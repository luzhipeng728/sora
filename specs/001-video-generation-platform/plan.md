# Implementation Plan: Video Generation Platform

**Branch**: `001-video-generation-platform` | **Date**: 2025-10-04 | **Spec**: User requirements (detailed below)
**Input**: User-provided requirements for video generation platform with authentication

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Build a complete video generation platform with user authentication system. Users can register, login, submit text prompts for video generation, and retrieve generated videos. The platform uses a streaming API for video generation with support for portrait (default) and landscape orientations. Generated videos are associated with and stored under user accounts. The system handles long-running generation jobs asynchronously with real-time progress updates.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Backend: Node.js 18+ / Python 3.11+; Frontend: TypeScript 5+
**Primary Dependencies**: Backend: Express/FastAPI + streaming middleware; Frontend: React 18+ / Vue 3+; Database ORM/middleware
**Storage**: PostgreSQL / MySQL with ORM for users, videos metadata; External video storage URLs from API
**Testing**: Backend: Jest/pytest; Frontend: Vitest/Jest + React Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Web application (browser-based), Server deployment (Linux/Docker)
**Project Type**: Web (frontend + backend separation required)
**Performance Goals**: Handle streaming connections, <2s initial response, real-time progress updates
**Constraints**: Must support long-polling/SSE for streaming API, handle concurrent users, secure authentication
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-user platform with user profiles, 3+ UI screens (registration, video creation, profile/gallery)

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Principle I: User-Centric Video Generation
✅ **PASS** - Design includes complete user journey: prompt submission → progress monitoring → video retrieval. All features support this flow.

### Principle II: Asynchronous Job Processing
✅ **PASS** - Streaming API integration planned for real-time progress updates. Jobs queued and processed asynchronously without blocking users.

### Principle III: Secure Authentication & Authorization
✅ **PASS** - User registration and login system planned as prerequisite. Videos associated with authenticated users only.

### Principle IV: Data Integrity & Persistence
✅ **PASS** - Database with ORM/middleware planned for user accounts and video metadata. No data loss acceptable.

### Principle V: Modern Frontend Architecture
✅ **PASS** - Modern framework (React/Vue) with component architecture. UI matches `screen_shoot/` specifications.

### Technical Architecture Standards Compliance
✅ **API Integration** - Hardcoded endpoint and token will be used as specified
✅ **Video Orientation** - Portrait (default) and landscape support with correct model selection
✅ **Technology Constraints** - Modern frontend + RESTful backend + database middleware planned

**Result**: All constitutional requirements satisfied. No violations to document.

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure selected. Frontend and backend are separated to enable independent deployment and scaling. Backend handles authentication, database operations, and proxying streaming video generation API. Frontend provides modern UI matching design specifications with real-time progress updates via SSE/WebSocket.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Contract-driven tasks:
  - auth-api.yaml → contract tests for /register, /login, /me endpoints [P]
  - video-api.yaml → contract tests for /videos (GET/POST), /videos/:id, /jobs/:id, /jobs/:id/stream [P]
- Data model-driven tasks:
  - User entity → User model + bcrypt hashing [P]
  - Video entity → Video model [P]
  - VideoJob entity → VideoJob model with state transitions [P]
  - Database migrations for all entities
- Service layer tasks:
  - AuthService (register, login, JWT generation)
  - VideoGenerationService (queue job, stream API, parse progress, store video)
  - Database connection and ORM setup
- API endpoint implementation (make contract tests pass):
  - Auth endpoints: POST /register, POST /login, GET /me
  - Video endpoints: GET /videos, POST /videos, GET /videos/:id
  - Job endpoints: GET /jobs/:id, GET /jobs/:id/stream (SSE)
- Frontend tasks:
  - Pages: Login, Register, VideoCreation, Profile/Gallery [P]
  - Components: OrientationSelector, ProgressBar, VideoCard, VideoPlayer [P]
  - Services: API client with SSE support, auth service
  - State management: User store, video store
- Integration from quickstart.md:
  - User registration flow integration test
  - User login flow integration test
  - Video generation (portrait) integration test
  - Video generation (landscape) integration test
  - Video playback integration test
  - Unauthorized access security test

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Phase 3.1: Project setup (backend/frontend scaffolding, dependencies)
- Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) - Contract tests, integration test stubs (MUST FAIL)
- Phase 3.3: Core Implementation - Database → Models → Services → API endpoints
- Phase 3.4: Frontend Implementation - Pages → Components → State management → API integration
- Phase 3.5: Integration - Connect frontend to backend, streaming implementation
- Phase 3.6: Polish - Error handling, security hardening, UI matching design specs
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files/modules)

**Estimated Output**: 40-50 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Key Dependencies**:
- Database schema must exist before model implementation
- Models must exist before services
- Services must exist before API endpoints
- Contract tests must fail before implementation
- Backend API must exist before frontend integration
- Auth must work before video generation features

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
